# graph-dsl

This DSL is consisted of three main parts, a parser, an interpreter, and some intermediate class structure that represent either a graph component or a function call.

Parser: 
- used simple regex matching to parse a string using the below EBNF rules.
- our DSL is not using tools like JavaCC and Antler since we find that simple regex is sufficient for our DSL as it doesnâ€™t need to deal with issues like recursive calls.
- output an object of structure that represents node, edge, graph, or a function call.


Interpreter:
- mainly utilize the GraphStream library to render an animation illustrating the whole process of graph traversal or other graph function calls.


EBNF:

     <Demo>        ::= {do <Algorithm> on <Graph> from <Node> to <Node>}
     <Graph>       ::= {graph {<Nodes>} {<Edges>}}
     <Node>        ::= <string>
     <Edge>        ::= {<Node> to <Node>}
                     | {<Node> to <Node> <number>}
     <Nodes>       ::=
                     | <Node> <Nodes>
     <Edges>       ::=
                     | <Edge> <Edges>
     <Algorithm>   ::= DFS
                     | BFS
                     | Dijkstra's


The following is an example of creating a simple graph with 6 nodes and 4 edges:

Graph GRAPH = Parser.parseGraph("{graph {A B C D E F} {{A to B} {A to D} {A to C} {C to E} {D to F}}}");


The following is an example of performing BFS on a graph with 4 edges:

String demo1 = "{do BFS on {graph {A B C D E F} {{A to B} {A to D} {A to C} {C to E} {D to F}}} from A to C}";
Interpreter.interpret(demo1);
