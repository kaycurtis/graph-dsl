# graph-dsl


At first, we decided which algorith is used on the search. After that, we use parser to parse a list of graph indicating all the nodes of in the graph and edges between each of the nodes that  are connected. Lastly , from demo class we call on DFS or BFS search the graph that was just created and also indicate the start node and then end node.
